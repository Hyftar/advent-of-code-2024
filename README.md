# Advent of Code 2024

My personnal solutions for the [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/)

## Usage

Download your input for each day and place them in the corresponding folder into an `input.txt` file (e.g. The day 1 input would be in the `lib/day_1/input.txt` file).

Running the solutions from `mix` where `1 2 3 4` are the days you want to execute.

```sh
mix run -- 1 2 3 4
```

Generating the solution for a specific day (from code or IEx):

```elixir
AdventOfCode2024.solve(1)
```
